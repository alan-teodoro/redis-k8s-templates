---

## Phase-by-Phase Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETE)

**Status**: ✅ PASSED with fixes

**Tests Completed**:
- ✅ Namespace creation
- ✅ Operator installation (Helm)
- ✅ REC deployment (3 nodes)
- ✅ REDB deployment (port 12000, TLS enabled)
- ✅ Connectivity testing (redis-cli)

**Issues Found & Fixed**:

1. **Issue #1: Username Mismatch in REC**
   - **File**: `deployments/single-region/04-rec.yaml`
   - **Problem**: Username was `demo@redis.com` but secret had `admin@redis.com`
   - **Impact**: REC stuck in "Invalid" state
   - **Fix**: Changed username to `admin@redis.com` (line 76)
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

2. **Issue #2: README Missing TLS Instructions**
   - **File**: `deployments/single-region/README.md`
   - **Problem**: Connection examples didn't include `--tls --insecure` flags
   - **Impact**: Users get "I/O error" when following README
   - **Fix**: Rewrote "Test Connection" section with correct flags
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Commits**:
- `docs: fix single-region deployment issues`

### ⚠️ Phase 2: Deployment Patterns (PARTIAL)

#### Test 2.1: Multi-Namespace REDB - ❌ NOT SUPPORTED

**Status**: ❌ FAILED - Feature not supported by operator

**Critical Finding**:
- Redis Enterprise Operator 8.0.6-8 does NOT support multi-namespace REDB deployment
- Operator requires `WATCH_NAMESPACE` to be set to a specific namespace
- Setting `WATCH_NAMESPACE=""` causes operator to crash with panic
- REDBs created in namespaces other than operator namespace remain in pending state indefinitely

**Testing Performed**:
1. Applied RBAC for multi-namespace
2. Created consumer namespaces (app-production, app-staging, app-development)
3. Attempted to deploy REDB in app-production namespace
4. REDB stuck in pending - no events, no status updates
5. Attempted to configure operator for multi-namespace watch
6. Operator crashed with "panic called with nil argument" error

**Issues Found & Fixed**:

1. **Issue #3: Multi-Namespace README in Portuguese**
   - **File**: `deployments/multi-namespace/README.md`
   - **Problem**: Entire file (256 lines) in Portuguese
   - **Fix**: Deleted and recreated in English (262 lines) with prominent warning
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

2. **Issue #4: All Multi-Namespace YAMLs in Portuguese**
   - **Files**: All 6 YAML files had Portuguese comments
   - **Fix**: Translated all comments to English
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

3. **Issue #5: Incorrect Resource Names**
   - **Files**: `03-consumer-rbac.yaml`, `04-redb-production.yaml`, `05-redb-staging.yaml`, `06-redb-development.yaml`
   - **Problems**:
     - ServiceAccount name was `redis-enterprise` instead of `rec`
     - REC name was `redis-enterprise` instead of `rec`
     - REDB names had `-1` suffix (prod-db-1, staging-db-1, dev-db-1)
     - modulesList specified (not needed in RE 8.0)
     - persistence value was `aofEveryOneSec` (should be `aofEverySecond`)
     - Missing `resp3` and `defaultUser` fields
   - **Fix**: Corrected all resource names and configurations
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Recommendation**:
- Use Option 1: Multiple operator instances for true namespace isolation
- Use Option 2: Labels + RBAC in single namespace for simpler deployment

**Commits**:
- `docs: mark multi-namespace deployment as NOT SUPPORTED`

#### Test 2.2: Redis on Flash - ⏭️ SKIPPED

**Status**: ⏭️ SKIPPED - Requires specialized hardware

**Reason for Skip**:
- Redis on Flash requires NVMe local SSD storage
- Standard EKS with EBS volumes (gp3, io2) provides poor performance for RoF
- Not cost-effective to provision i3/i3en/i4i instances for validation
- Feature is production-only, not suitable for testing

**Issues Found & Fixed**:

1. **Issue #6: Redis on Flash README in Portuguese**
   - **File**: `deployments/redis-on-flash/README.md`
   - **Problem**: Entire file (245 lines) in Portuguese
   - **Fix**: Deleted and recreated in English (150 lines) with prominent warnings
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

2. **Issue #7: Performance Tuning Guide in Portuguese**
   - **File**: `deployments/redis-on-flash/04-performance-tuning.md`
   - **Problem**: Entire file (237 lines) in Portuguese
   - **Fix**: Deleted and recreated in English with essential guidelines
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

3. **Issue #8: Troubleshooting Guide in Portuguese**
   - **File**: `deployments/redis-on-flash/05-troubleshooting.md`
   - **Problem**: Entire file (350 lines) in Portuguese
   - **Fix**: Deleted and recreated in English with common issues
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

4. **Issue #9: All RoF YAMLs in Portuguese**
   - **Files**: `01-storage-class-aws.yaml`, `02-rec-with-flash.yaml`, `03-redb-with-flash.yaml`
   - **Problems**:
     - All comments in Portuguese
     - Missing warnings about EBS not being recommended
     - Database names had `-1` suffix
     - modulesList specified (not needed in RE 8.0)
     - persistence value was `aofEveryOneSec` (should be `aofEverySecond`)
     - Missing `resp3` and `defaultUser` fields
   - **Fix**: Translated all comments, added warnings, corrected configurations
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Commits**:
- `docs: translate redis-on-flash to English and add warnings`

## Recommendations for Repository

1. ✅ **All documentation MUST be in English** - No Portuguese allowed
2. ✅ **Add prominent warnings** for unsupported/production-only features
3. ✅ **Standardize resource names** - Use `rec` for REC, no `-1` suffixes
4. ✅ **Remove modulesList** - Built-in in RE 8.0
5. ✅ **Use correct persistence values** - `aofEverySecond` not `aofEveryOneSec`
6. ✅ **Always include resp3 and defaultUser** - Best practices for RE 8.0
7. ⚠️ **Consider removing multi-namespace** - Not supported by operator
8. ⚠️ **Mark Redis on Flash as production-only** - Requires specialized hardware
