# Self-Signed ClusterIssuer for cert-manager
#
# This creates a self-signed certificate issuer for testing/development.
# Certificates issued by this issuer will NOT be trusted by browsers/clients
# without manual trust configuration.
#
# Use Case: Testing, development, internal lab environments
#
# For production, see 02-cluster-issuer.yaml for other issuer options:
# - CA Issuer (existing Certificate Authority)
# - Vault Issuer (HashiCorp Vault integration)
# - ACME/Let's Encrypt (public-facing endpoints)
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl apply -f 02a-selfsigned-issuer.yaml
#
# Verify:
#   kubectl get clusterissuer selfsigned-issuer
#   kubectl describe clusterissuer selfsigned-issuer
